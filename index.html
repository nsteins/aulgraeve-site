<h2>FREQUENTLY ANSWERED QUESTIONS</h2>

<p>WHEN AND WHERE IS AUL GRAEVE</p>
<p class='filler'>AUL GRAEVE IS A FEELING. IT IS THE SHIVER IN YOUR CHEST AND THE STING ON YOUR FACE. IT IS AN UNSPECIFIED SENSE OF LOSS. IT IS A LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE, COLD AND WHITE. IT LIVES IN YOUR DREAMS AND IN YOUR FEARS.</p>

<p class='filler'>IT WILL ALSO BE AT MY HOME ON <b>JANUARY 18, 2025</b> BEGINNING AT 3PM</p>

<p>WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT THE AUL GRAEVE CELEBRATION</p>
<p class='filler'>THERE WILL BE A GIFT EXCHANGE, HELD BY TRADITIONAL AUCTION RULES. THERE WILL BE FOOD AND DRINK. THERE WILL BE TIME FOR STORY TELLING AND SINGING OF TRADITIONAL AUL GRAEVE CAROLS. THERE WILL BE REJOICING.</p>

<p><i>TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GIFT AUCTION, PLEASE BRING A GIFT. IT MUST NOT BE SOMETHING PURCHASED, AND IT MUST BE WRAPPED IN SOMETHING THAT IS NOT WRAPPING PAPER.</i></p>

<p>WHY IS AUL GRAEVE IN PERSON THIS YEAR?</p>
<p class='filler'>IT WAS A SURPRISE BLESSING TO BE ABLE TO REACH SO MANY FRIENDS, NEW AND OLD, THROUGH THE WONDERS OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB. BUT AUL GRAEVE HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN CELEBRATED FACE TO FACE, IN A SMALL CORNER OF LIGHT, HUDDLED AWAY FROM THE DARKNESS. AND HONESTLY, ORGANIZING A DISTRIBUTED EVENT TAKES A LOT OF PLANNING AND ORGANIZATION, AND THOSE WHO KNOW ME WELL (AT ALL), KNOW THOSE AREN'T EXACTLY IN MY SPARKLE ZONE.</p>

<p class='filler'>WE'RE STILL TAKING THE RISK OF COVID AT AN INDOOR EVENT SERIOUSLY. WE'LL HAVE AS MUCH AIR FILTRATION AS WE CAN MUSTER AND, AS ALWAYS, WE ASK ANYONE WHO IS FEELING ILL TO STAY HOME AND REST.</p>

<p>HOW CAN I CELEBRATE AUL GRAEVE ON MY OWN?</p>
<p class='filler'>WANDER IN THE BLINDING SNOW. LISTEN TO THE SOUNDS FROM ABOVE. FREEZE IN THE WIND UNTIL YOU FEEL THE ILLUSION OF WARMTH.</p>

<p class='filler'>IN ADDITION TO THE POSSIBLE MAIL-IN EXCHANGE, THESE RESOURCES MAY HELP YOU CELEBRATE IN YOUR OWN WAY:</p>

<p>CAN I INVITE MY FRIENDS/FAMILY/THRALLS TO JOIN</p>
<p class='filler'>LIKE ANY GOOD CULT, AUL GRAEVE WELCOMES NEW FOLLOWERS INTO THE FOLD WITH OPEN ARMS. PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY ARE PROPERLY INFORMED AND PREPARED FOR THE EXPERIENCE THEY WILL HAVE.</p>

<p>ARE CHILDREN WELCOME</p>
<p class='filler'>WE WOULD LOVE FOR YOUR CHILDREN TO JOIN US. WE FIND IT IS BEST TO START THE INDOCTRINATION OF AUL GRAEVE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE.</p>
